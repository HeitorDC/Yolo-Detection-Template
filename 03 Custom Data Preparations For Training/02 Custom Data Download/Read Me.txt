OIDv4 is a tool kit which is used to download large images for the training purpose
In my Pc it is already installed in Rishav/OIDv4 go to that directory and run python main.py
OpenImagesDataset is a website where u can see tons of images for the required dataset
Select your class on the website
download the class via command prompt as
python main.py downloader --classes Car Bicycle_wheel Bus --type_csv train --multiclasses 1 --limit 9


Once Downloaded:-
The download folder has one class flode with csv file containing annotations and images.


Convert Download data to Yolo Format
The format is same as down in previous Labelling folder
Labelling.data
	classes
	train
	test
	names
	backup


The annotaions in csv file is different from the required Yolo Annotations.
To achieve the conversion use converting-annotations.py present in same folder.
create a classes.txt file in the downloaded image folder and write classes names in each line same as done in previous section
Once the image downloaded is converted in YOLO format then rest two python files can be used to prepare the yolo
training file as done in previous sections
